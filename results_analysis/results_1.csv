It's a 50 second music inside a google forms so it's hard to care enough to make a story (at least for me). Also because the song is piano only and feels particularly unninspired (don't mean to criticize whoever made it though). Regardless, I think music can guide us into thinking about certain things, enhance or change the emotion of a narrative, but I personally believe it doesn't really create a story. Hence maybe why I didn't think of one. It's the oposite of a book in that sense. It's more about what each person interprets. I think a lot of people would think of a story though, and probably simmilar in form, but different in specifics. It's the same with body language I feel. Each people interprets an expression or gesture differently, but it's just one gesture, and it's only different in the minds of whoever interprets it. (sry about my copypasta, but I've though about this a bit and thought the topic was interesting) best of luck","1","1","","1","1","1","1","I kept thinking: ""when's the part where the wizard gives him a gift"", I kept waiting for the link opens a chest sfx, but it never came. Also, it really doesn't feel like it's a wizard testing a hero, more like going down the stairs after a long day. I think knowing what you'd intended didn't really help me understand the song, so maybe we're just bad at communicating with each other mr Francisco"
